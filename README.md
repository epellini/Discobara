# **Discobara!**
This mobile game brings rhythm and fun right to your fingertips. It's a straightforward disco-themed game where how quick you swipe determines if you win or loose. Made using C# in the Unity Engine.

## Features

**Global Leaderboards:** Powered by [Google Play Services](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/overview), see how you stack up against dancers worldwide.

## Why this project?
I like capybaras and disco music, so I merged them together into a game. My goal was to create a game that's super easy to get into, but also keeps you on your toes. I also wanted an extra challenge, so I learned about Google Play Services and added an authentication and leaderboard features to keep track of high scores for players globally.
